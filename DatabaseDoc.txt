We have Users, who have a name and password:

{
  _id: PERSON_ID,
  name: "Mike Dirolf"
  pw: "Some Hashed Password"
}
We have a separate collection of Addresses, where each address maintains a reference to a single Person:

{
  _id: ADDRESS_ID,
  person: PERSON_ID,
  address: "mike@corp.fiesta.cc"
}
We have Recipes, each of which is basically just an ID (IRL there is some more group-specific metadata that would be in here as well, but weâ€™re going to ignore it to focus on the relationships):

{
  _id: GROUP_ID
}
Lastly, we have RecipesToUsers, which associate a Person with a Group. Each Membership includes the list name that the Person is using for the Group, and a reference to the Address that they want to receive mail at for that Group:

{
  _id: MEMBERSHIP_ID,
  person: PERSON_ID,
  group: GROUP_ID,
  address: ADDRESS_ID,
  group_name: "family"
}
